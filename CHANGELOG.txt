  * === Now works on Linux from source (rolled back some libraries for maximum compatibility).
  * === Now works on OS X from source (rolled back some libraries for maximum compatibility).
  * === Executable for OS X 10.6 added.

  * Crown heals now, rather than allowing the wearer to fly (can still fly using the carpet, though!).

  * Instructions page, telling you how to play.
  * Audio settings in options.
  * Controls (keys/gamepad) settings in options.
  * Throwing items now makes them travel a lot further (Except throwing animals, which generally is less far now).
  * Creatures can be knocked down if hit with a sufficiently large thrown object.
  * Added a disaster to the forest/dryad level (trees awaken), the island level (lava rocks) and the pirate ship level (lightning).
  * Replaced game text overlay with a graphical overlay.

  * FIXED: Ready indicators are left on when leaving a game.

  * FIXED: Player objects skid around the screen when the game ends.
