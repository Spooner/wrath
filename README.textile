h1. === Wrath! ===

* "Github project (Spooner/wrath)":https://github.com/Spooner/wrath

h2. Description

Wrath! is a retro 2.5D game in which both players must make sacrifices and mayhem in order to appease the gods.

h3. User settings

Wrath saves per-user-settings in the '~/.wrath' folder (This is probably 'C:\Users\<username>\.wrath\' on Windows).
Until a proper way to edit settings is implemented, if you need to change network port or change keys, you should edit
these YAML files manually.

h3. Logs

Wrath creates a log every time it runs. If you have problems or crashes, it will help to include a copy of the log
in your report :)
