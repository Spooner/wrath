h2. Description

_Wrath: Appease or Die!_ is a retro 2.5D game in which both players must make sacrifices and mayhem in order to appease the gods.

h2. Requirements

h3. Windows

If running <tt>wrath.exe</tt>, there are no other requirements.

h3. OS X

If running OS X 10.6, use the executable (<tt>Wrath.app</tt>), which has no dependencies. If not, the only option is running from source (details below).

h3. Source for Linux (or Windows/OS X if not using the executable)

If running from source, users must install the Ruby interpreter and some rubygems. Linux users must also install some "extra dependencies":https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Linux for Gosu.

h4. Dependencies

* Ruby 1.9.2 (Install via package manager or rvm)
** Gosu gem 0.7.32 (Dependencies: "Linux only":https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Linux)
** A number of other rubygems, which can be installed automatically using Bundler (see below).

h4. Using Bundler to install gems

If the Bundler gem isn't already installed, that can be installed with:

<pre>
    gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
</pre>

In the game's main directory (with <tt>Gemfile</tt> in it), use Bundler to automatically install the correct gem versions:

<pre>
    bundle install
</pre>

h4. Running the game

May need to use <tt>ruby19</tt> rather than <tt>ruby</tt>. Depends how you installed Ruby 1.9.2!

<pre>
    ruby bin/wrath.rbw
</pre>

h2. How to Play

On each level, the players (priests) have to attempt to sacrifice animals, people or treasures on the altar, in order to appease the gods and avoid the worst of their wrath. From sacrifice, the player gains holy favour (white bar) and the first to achieve a given level of favour wins. A priest also must avoid being killed. Losing all your health (red bar) will lead to losing the game.

Priests can move using 4 directional keys and  and also perform an action. An action can be pick up, throw, sacrifice, use A on B, etc., depending on context and is initiated using a single key. Controls can be configured in _Options->Controls_.

h3. 2 players sharing a keyboard

Player 1 controls the priest on the left-hand side. Player 2 controls the priest on the right-hand side.

* Player 1 controls: WASD + Space
* Player 2 controls: Arrow keys + RightShift

Note: The game only supports a single gamepad, so only one of the players may use one at a time. Enable this in _Options->Controls_.

h3. 2 players connected over the Internet/LAN

The host will need to ensure that the port (which can be configured) is open in their router if playing across the Internet. If this is not possible, it is recommended using something like "Hamachi 2 (unmanaged, free version)":https://secure.logmein.com/UK/products/hamachi2/download.aspx to avoid this.

Host controls the left-hand priest. Client controls the right-hand priest.

* Player controls: WASD + Space

h3. User settings

Wrath saves per-user settings in the <tt>~/.wrath_spooner</tt> folder (This is probably <tt>C:\Users\MyUsername\.wrath_spooner\</tt> on Windows). If you have problems, deleting this folder will return you to default settings.
