h1. === Wrath: Appease or Die! ===

* "Github project (Spooner/wrath)":https://github.com/Spooner/wrath

h2. Description

_Wrath: Appease or Die!_ is a retro 2.5D game in which both players must make sacrifices and mayhem in order to appease the gods.

h3. User settings

Wrath saves per-user-settings in the <tt>~/.wrath_spooner</tt> folder (This is probably <tt>C:\Users\<username>\.wrath_spooner\</tt> on Windows).

h3. Logs

Wrath creates a log every time it runs. If you have problems or crashes, it will help to include a copy of the log
in your report :)

h2. Requirements

h3. Windows

If running <tt>wrath.exe</tt>, there are no other requirements.

h3. OS X [10.6 only!]

If running OS X 10.6, use the executable. If not, the only option is running from source (details below).

If running <tt>wrath.app</tt>, there are no other requirements.

NOTE: there is no .app file available for the current version of the game!

h3. Source for Linux (or Windows/OS X if not using the executable)

* Ruby 1.9.2
** Gosu gem 0.7.29 (Dependencies: "Linux":https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Linux or "OS X":https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-OS-X)
** Chingu gem 0.9rc4
** Chipmunk gem 5.2.2.0
** Fidgit gem 0.0.5alpha
** Texplay gem 0.3.5

Both Gosu and Chipmunk _must_ be that exact version (not newer or older), or the game may not work.

h4. Using Bundler to install gems (strongly recommended)

In the game's main directory (with <tt>Gemfile</tt> in it), use Bundler to automatically install the correct gem versions:

<pre>
    bundle install
</pre>

    If the Bundler gem isn't already installed, that can be installed with:

<pre>
    gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
</pre>

h3. Running the game

May need to use <tt>ruby19</tt> rather than <tt>ruby</tt>. Depends how you installed Ruby 1.9.2!

<pre>
    ruby bin/wrath.rbw
</pre>
