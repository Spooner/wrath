      gods:
        title: The Gods
        body: |
          * Gods are wrathful and enjoy smiting more than anything else (well, except seducing mortals)!

          * Each map has a local deity that you must appease, such as the god of earthquakes or storms.

          * Gods slowly become angry then they rain down disasters until they become bored (anger bar fills then empties).

          * As you make sacrifices, it reduces the anger of the god as well as giving you Holy Favour.

          * The god will ask for specific creatures, which will reap greater rewards when sacrificed.

      priests:
        title: Priests
        body: |
           * Each player picks one of thirteen priests. All priests are identical in play, but some look cooler than others.

           * Your priest can pick up, use or throw objects or creatures. They do this with a single "action" key.

           * A priest's current health is shown as a red bar next to her portrait.

           * Dying will mean the other player wins by default!

      favour:
        title: Holy Favour
        body: |
          * Accumulate favour by making sacrifices at the altar (priests start standing next to the altar).

          * The gods like animals, people and treasures as sacrifices, but dislike mundane things, like rocks.

          * Creatures can be anointed at the font to give more favor when sacrificed.

          * Your holy favour is shown as a white bar. Fill the bar before the other priest to win!

          * Favour can also be used to power magical items (e.g. magic carpets).
