  :title: The Gods
  :body: |
    * Gods are wrathful and enjoy smiting more than anything else (well, except seducing mortals)!

    * Each map has a local deity that you must appease, such as the god of earthquakes or storms.

    * Gods slowly become angry then they rain down disasters until they become bored (anger bar fills then empties).

    * As you make sacrifices, it reduces the anger of the god as well as giving you Holy Favour.

  :title: Priests
  :body: |
     * Each player picks one of eight priests. All priests are identical in play, but some look cooler than others.

     * Your priest can pick up, use or throw objects or creatures. They do this with a single "action" key.

     * A priest's current health is shown as a red bar next to her portrait.

     * Dying will mean the other player wins by default!

  :title: Holy Favour
  :body: |
    * Accumulate favour by making sacrifices at the altar (priests start standing next to the altar).

    * The gods like animals, people and treasures as sacrifices, but dislike mundane things, like rocks.

    * Your holy favour is shown as a white bar. Fill the bar before the other priest to win!

    * Favour can also be used to power magical items (e.g. magic carpets).
