    * Each map has a local deity that you must appease, such as the god of earthquakes or storms.
    * Gods slowly become angry then they rain down disasters until they become bored (anger bar fills then empties).
    * As you make sacrifices, you also reduce the anger of the god.

    * Accumulate favour by making sacrifices at the altar. The gods like animals, people and treasures sacrificed, but dislike mundane things.
    * Your holy favour is shown as a white bar. Fill the bar before the other priest to win!
    * Favour can also be used to power magical items (e.g. magic carpets).
